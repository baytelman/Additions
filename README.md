# README

This is just a collection of categories for objective-c that I have collected, altered, and created over the years as an Objective-C developer.  A good handful of contributions have been made to this collection from Kevin Musselman and others.

The documentation sucks, and this is mainly so i have a spot for me to use this as a submodule.  But feel free to fork it and make changes, and if you so chose, I will always be open to pull requests.

# To Use

Just copy the files where ever you want them in your project and include "Additions.h" in your prefetch.
